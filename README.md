# Simple Login System

## Overview

The Simple Login System is a basic web application that implements user authentication. It provides user registration and login functionalities using JavaScript and stores user data in the local storage of the browser. The system validates user input during registration, and users can log in with their registered credentials.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Users can sign up by providing a name, username and password. The system validates the input and stores user data in the local storage.

- **User Login**: Registered users can log in using their credentials. The system verifies the login information against the stored user data.

- **Local Storage Management**: User data is stored locally using JavaScript, ensuring that users can log in even after refreshing the page.

- **Error Handling**: The system provides feedback to users in case of registration or login errors, such as invalid input or incorrect credentials.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: The structure of the login system is built using HTML for a well-defined layout.

- **CSS**: Cascading Style Sheets are utilized to style the HTML elements and improve visual presentation.

- **Bootstrap**: The Bootstrap framework is integrated to enhance the design and responsiveness of the user interface.

- **JavaScript**: The core functionality, including user registration, login validation, and local storage management, is implemented using JavaScript.
